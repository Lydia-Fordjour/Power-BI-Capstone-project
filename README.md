Uncovering Trends in Police Shootings: A Data-Driven Analysis

This repository presents a comprehensive Power BI project examining police shootings trends across the United States from 2015 to 2020. 
Through interactive visualizations and in-depth reports, this project aims to provide insights into the complex issues surrounding police use of force.

Project Overview
The project consists of:

- Dashboard: The dash board talks about the total number of shootings, the percentage of armed and unarmed victims, the mental health of the victims and their manner of death.
- From the dashboard, total number of shootings was 4,895 which occurred in 51 different states and 2287 cities in the USA.
- From this shooting incident, only about 12% of the case was recorded on body camera with about 93% of the victims being armed.
- The highest number of victims fell within the youthful ages of 25 to 45 which shows that the youth might be engaging in criminal activities.
- Looking at the line chat, it can be seen that the rate of killings reduced across the years.
- 
- Two In-Depth Reports:
    - Police Shootings Report: From the police, only 578 of the shooting cases not recorded out of 4,895 which makes it hard to know what truly happened in the crime scene to cause the shootings.
    - There are other visuals like the map, that shows the states and the shooting incident.
    - There is also the pie chat that shows the threat level of the victims. From this report, about 65% of the victims attacked which could be the reason they were killed.
    - Victim Actions Report: From this report, about 23% of the victims had mental illness cases.
    - A chat was made to show the top 10 weapons that was mostly used by the victims and gun topped them.
    - Top states with the highest victims were visualized and the state with the highes number of cases was California.
    - A bar chat was used to compare the number of victims by their races to determine if this shooting incident has something to do with racism.
    - From this visual, the highest number of victims were the whites, followed by blacks which makes sense because according to the 2025 population by race that was carried out in the USA,
      about 64% of the citizens are whites and about 12% are blacks so per these results, it can be concluded that the shooting incidents has nothing to do with racism.
